# Homomorphic Encryption and its uses in the current technological landscape
<sub>by John Narte</sub>

Homomorphic Encryption is a cryptographic technique that enables complex computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption.
With homomorphic encryption, organizations can securely store, process, and exchange data while preserving privacy and security, such as in the case of customer data or personal data.
This technology holds significance in fields that require protection of sensitive data such as healthcare, finance, and data privacy i.e. cloud services.
