## Introduction
Homomorphic Encryption is a cryptographic technique that enables complex computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption.
In today's digital age, data is quite literally the lifeblood of businesses and organizations worldwide.
The more data we generate and share, the more risks there are to data privacy and security
With homomorphic encryption, organizations can securely store, process, and exchange data while preserving privacy and security, such as in the case of customer data or personal data.
This blog will delve deeper into homomorphic encryption, providing and in-depth understanding of its principles, different types, real-world applications, examples, and challenges of its implementation
