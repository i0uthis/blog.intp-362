## brief intro about homomorphic encryption
Homomorphic Encryption refers to the encryption scheme that allows computations directly on encrypted data without requiring the data to be decrypted first. The result of the encrypted computations will remain encrypted and can only be decrypted with the secret key only known to the data owner. This keeps the integrity of the encryption as only one person is privy to the key which protects the dataâ€™s confidentiality. In this blog we will talk about various open-source homomorphic encryption libraries that have been published over the past decade. We will also go over a demonstration of one such libraries to show how Homomorphic Encryption works.

## Different Libraries
There is a plethora of libraries about homomorphic encryption, in fact there is a GitHub repository dedicated to just listing these libraries.[4] From the list the ones that I have heard or seen before are PALISADE, SEAL, and HElib. PALISADE is a DARPA and IARPA-funded project, SEAL was developed by the Microsoft Research Cryptography Research Group, and HElib was developed by Shai Halevi and Victor Shoup both of which are popular figures in the cryptographic community.[2]
